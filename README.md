## 2. Tools Installation
Most of projects in 91springboard are Javascript based and you'll need following tools to begin with.

Depending upon your operating system (Windows, Linux, or MacOS) and bit version (32 bit or 64 bit), install the following tools:

 1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. Git is also used by npm and bower package managers to install project's development and code dependencies.

 1. [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm): Simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions.

 1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node also contains **npm** package manager which is used to download project dependencies. Use **nvm** to install a particular node version.

 1. [Bower](https://bower.io/): Bower is a package manager to download and manage code dependencies.

    Execute `bower -v`. If it shows a version it means bower is already installed. If not, execute `npm install -g bower` to install bower globally.

    Bower is installed using NPM (NPM has already been installed along with Node in the above step).

 1. [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/): JSDoc is an API documentation generator for JavaScript.

     Execute `npm install -g jsdoc` to install JSDoc globally because JSDoc will be used in many projects to generate HTML version of code documentation.

 1. BitBucket's SourceTree: SourceTree is a GUI app to simplify your interactions with Git and Mercurial repositories. You do not need to write commands in the terminal.

       - MacOS: [Install SourceTree v2.1](https://downloads.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/SourceTree_2.1.dmg). Latest version have login issues.
       - Windows: [Install SourceTree latest version](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

 1. [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/): It is the best Javascript IDE but you'll need a license to use this app. Please contact Pooja Gulrajani (pooja@91springboard.com) for license requirements. In case a license is not available, you may install Sublime Text editor which is described next.

 1. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3): Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor. It is free to use.
